Caps Parameter Parsing
======================

Caps parsing is a difficult thing. A caps is an array of structures, each one with caps type,
features, and fields. In addition, caps can also be "ANY", "EMPTY" and NULL, and each option is
different.
In order to overcome this problem, caps should be parsed in this fashion:

- If caps are NULL, the content of the caps variable will be a string stating it
- If caps are ANY, the content of the caps variable will be the string "ANY"
- If caps are EMPTY, the content of the caps variable will be the string "EMPTY"
- If a specific caps structure is provided, it should be parsed as follows:
    - Every caps structure, containing a type, features, and fields, will be parsed into a 
    sub-dictionry with three fields:
        - type field, holding the caps mime-type (e.g. video/x-raw, application/x-rtp)
        - optional features field, holding a string describing the caps features
        - value field, holding an array of strings, each one represents a caps field
    - All the caps structures should be packed into an array of sub-directories
