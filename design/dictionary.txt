Dictionary
==========

The dictionary is an object that holds all the data read from a parameter, an element
or a plugin. This data container should be able to hold three types of objects: strings,
arrays, and sub-dictionaries.

A string should be of type gchar *, and a const version should be retruned to the user. 
The dictionary should free the string. A sub-dictionary should be of the type of the dictionary,
and a const pointer to it should be returned. Again, it is the dictionary's responsibility to free
the sub-directory.

Array should be an array of entries of the same type. Array should be a GValue of type 
GST_TYPE_ARRAY, and should hold GValue, and can hold any of the available data types, 
meaning strings, arrays and sub-dictionaries. Types can be distinguished by the GType 
of the first GValue in the array.

GstStructures should be used as dictionaries, as they implement all needed functionality,
allow data retrieving based on string/ID, and manage themselves.
