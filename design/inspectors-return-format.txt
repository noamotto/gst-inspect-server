Inspector's inspection result format
====================================

The returned format for each inspector should be as follows:
- If the inspector succeeded in its inspection, a dictionary containing the inspected
data should be returned. The name of any dictionary (GstStructure) does not have to 
have any meaning, and should not be read. Instead, the field name assigned to the 
dictionary should be informative.
- If the inspector could not find any data to inspect, the inspector should return 
NULL. In this case its result will not be added to the main inspection result 
dictionary.
- If the inspection failed due to some error, Its dictionary should contain only
one string field describing the error, under an "Error" field name.
- Additional possible inspection result can be returned if the inspection failed 
before the inspectors were invoked. This dictionary should also contain only one 
string field describing the error, under the "Error" field name.

Note that in order to set the shown name for each inspector, each inspector should
be registered with two strings:
1. A name, for identification.
2. A longname, that should be used as the inspector's result dictionary's field name.
