Inspector's inspection result format
====================================

The returned format for each inspector should be as follows:
- If the inspector succeeded in its inspection, a GValue containing the inspected
data should be returned. The GValue should contain data which can be held by a 
dictionary. The name of each dictionary does not have to be informative. Instead,
the field name assigned to the dictionary should be informative.
- If the inspector could not find any data to inspect, the inspector should return 
an uninitinalized GValue. In this case its result will not be added to the main 
inspection result dictionary.
- If the inspection failed due to some error, Its dictionary should contain only
one string field describing the error, under an "Error" field name.
- Additional possible inspection result can be returned if the inspection failed 
before the inspectors were invoked. This dictionary should also contain only one 
string field describing the error, under the "Error" field name.

Note that in order to set the shown name for each inspector, each inspector should
be registered with two strings:
1. A name, for identification.
2. A longname, that should be used as the inspector's result data's field name.
