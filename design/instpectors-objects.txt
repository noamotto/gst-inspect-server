Inspector Objects
=================

An inspector object is a static object capable of inspecting an element or a plugin.
Currently there are two types of inspectors, one for each of those objects. 

Because an inspector is a static object, it is represented as a functon. It should 
expect either a GstElement or a GstPlugin, depending on the inspector's type, and 
should return a dictionary filled with the inspected data, or NULL if no data was
found.
