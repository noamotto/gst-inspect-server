gst-inspectors Utilities
========================

In addition to the core several methods should be implemented, for easier access 
and usage.

An initialization function for the library should be implemented, to initialize 
the inspector lists with preset inspectors (as found in gst-inspect today). This
function should be called before any call to the library's API.

The main one will be a function that will inspect object by name, meaning it will
recieve a name of an element of a plugin, and will look for it. If the method finds
an object matching the given name it will inspect it return a dictionary with the
inspection result. If not an error message should be returned.

More methods should be added if neccessary.
