gst-inspectors core
===================

The core of this library should be a simple system that manages lists of inspectors
for different types of inspectable objects (currently only elements and plugins).

Two different API set of functions should be used for elements and plugins. Those 
sets should include:
1. An insertion function, allowing the user to register a new inspector at given
location.
2. A deletion function, allowing the user to remove a registered inspector by name
3. Querying function. Should return a list of the registered inspectors' names.

The system should allow two types inspections of every type of inspectable objects:
- A full inspection should run through all the inspectors registered for the given
type of object, in order of registration, and create an unified dictionary with the
inspectors' results.
- A custom inspection should recieve a list of inspectors to invoke, and invoke them
in given order. (note that this operation will probably be less effecient).

The inspectors will be held in linked lists, to allow a consistent order of inspectors,
insertion to random spots easily and easy removal. The inspectors will be registered
with a name as ID, meaning inpectors should have unique names. One should be able to 
query the list of resitered inspectors' name using the API.
