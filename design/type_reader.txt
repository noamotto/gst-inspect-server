Type readers are functions that get as input a GParamSpec and a GValue, and outputs a
dictionary of strings, describing the parameter. The dictionary is represented by a GstStructure.
The GValue should hold a valid value of the GParamSpec type.

Functions should be abled to be registered easily, to create a dinamyic and easily extendable
system. In addition, another two systems should be provided, to register special handlers for
GBoxed types and GObject types.

A special function will recieve the GParamSpec and GValue, and choose the right function to
handle them. A default handling function will be invoked when no matching handler is found.
