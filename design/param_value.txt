Parameter Value Field
=======================

The value field in a parameter can be of any of the possible types.

- A string value should simply describe the parameter's value. It is mainly used for 
simple types, like primitives
- An array value should hold an array of equally sized components, describing the parameter.
It can be used to describe a list and such
- A sub-directory value should be used for complex types that their value should be described
in multiple fields. This sub-directry can hold in its turn any of the possible data types.
The value sub-dictionary can hold a value field of its own, to mark a field as the primary field
of value (Like caps fields vs caps features).
