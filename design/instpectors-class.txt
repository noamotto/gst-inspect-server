Inspectors Class
================

The GstInspector is the main object in this library.

Its purpose is to inspect a specific aspect of a GstElement or GstPlugin.
It should be a GObject, probably inheriting from GstObject of GObject directly,
and should expose a couple of things:
1. name - For identiication purposes
2. type - Whether this inspector inspects GstElements or GstPlugins
3. inspection function - A function that recieves an object for inspection

The ease things two sub-classes should inhert from it directly, one for GstElements 
and one for GstPlugins. This will also solve the typing issue.

Every single inspector should inherit from one of those sub-classes, implementing a 
custom inspection function. The inpection function should receive 1 argument:
- The object to inspect (GstObject by default. Will be type-checked whether it's a 
GstElementFactory or GstPlugin)
And return one argument:
- A dictionary with inspected data, to be merged, or NULL if no data was inspected.

The inspectors will be registered to the library's core, and should be used from there.
The library will maintain
