Inspectors Subclasses
=====================

The GstInspector baseclass currently has two sub-classes, one for plugins and one
for elements. In the future, if needed, this list can be expanded.

The two subclasses should be:
- GstElementInspector - Inspects GstElementFactories. Implementations of this class
should implement the inspect_element() method, which should have a signature similar
to GstInspector's.
- GstPluginInspector - Inspects GstPlugins. Implementations of this class should
implement the inspect_plugin() method, which should have a signature similar to
GstInspector's.

Currently any implementation of a GstInspector should derive from one if these classes.
